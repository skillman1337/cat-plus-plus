        Analyzing Memory Usage Profiles: Unmasking Memory Mysteries

      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Imagine you're a detective investigating a crime scene, but instead of
        searching for fingerprints, you're on the hunt for memory leaks! In C++,
        understanding how your program uses memory is crucial for writing
        efficient and robust applications. This chapter equips you with the
        tools and techniques to become a memory detective, analyzing memory
        usage profiles to identify and resolve memory-related issues.

      >{`// Example of a potential memory leak
#include <iostream>

void leakyFunction() {
  // Dynamically allocate memory on the heap
  int *ptr = new int;

  // Oops! We forgot to deallocate the memory 
  // pointed to by 'ptr' before exiting the function.
}

int main() {
  // Call the function that leaks memory
  leakyFunction();

  // ... other code ...

  return 0;
}`}</SyntaxHighlighter>

      {/* Explanation */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In this example, the <code>leakyFunction</code> dynamically allocates
        memory for an integer using <code>new</code>. However, it fails to
        deallocate this memory using <code>delete</code> before exiting the
        function. This omission results in a memory leakâ€”the allocated memory
        remains inaccessible and unusable by the program, leading to wasted
        resources and potentially crashing your application if left unchecked.
      </p>

      <p>
        To track down these memory mysteries, we use tools called memory
        profilers. These handy tools give us a snapshot of how our program is
        using memory. Think of it like a map that highlights the areas where
        memory is being held captive!

        You've been given a program that seems to be hoarding memory like a

        the culprit code section responsible for this memory-hoarding behavior.

          Hint: Pay close attention to memory allocation patterns. Are there any

          allocating memory without deallocating it.

            **1. What is a memory leak, and why is it a problem?**
            <br />A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails
            to release it back to the system when it's no longer needed. This
            leads to a gradual increase in memory consumption, which can
            eventually cause the program to slow down, crash, or become
            unresponsive.
