        Memory Leak Detection Tools: Hunting Down Memory Goblins

      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Imagine a mischievous goblin sneaking into your program, snatching up
        bits of memory and refusing to let go! üòà That's essentially what a
        memory leak is. Over time, these leaks can slow down your program,
        cause crashes, and leave you scratching your head in confusion. But fear
        not! Just like we have goblin hunters, the C++ world offers powerful
        tools to detect and exterminate these memory leaks.

#include <iostream>

void leakyFunction() {
  int *ptr = new int; // Allocate memory on the heap
  // Oops! We forgot to delete ptr!
}

int main() {
  while (true) {
    leakyFunction(); // This function leaks memory with each call!
  }

        Valgrind: The Memory Detective
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Valgrind is like a seasoned detective with a magnifying glass,
        meticulously inspecting your program for memory leaks and other memory
        management errors. It's a powerful command-line tool that can help you
        track down even the most elusive leaks.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        To use Valgrind, you would typically compile your program with
        debugging symbols (using the -g flag) and then run it through Valgrind
        like so:

`}</SyntaxHighlighter>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Valgrind will then give you a detailed report, pointing out any memory
        leaks, invalid memory accesses, and other memory-related issues. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

            **1. What is a memory leak, and why is it harmful?**
            <br />
            A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to
            release it after it's no longer needed. This prevents the memory
            from being reused, leading to reduced performance, potential
            crashes, and instability.
          </p>
          <p>
            **2. Name at least two memory leak detection tools available for
            C++.**
            <br />
            - Valgrind
            <br />
            - AddressSanitizer (ASan)
            <br />
            - LeakSanitizer (LSan)
          </p>
          <p>
            **3. How can you compile your C++ program to make it easier for
            memory leak detectors to find issues?**
            <br />
            Compile your program with debugging symbols enabled. This is
            typically done using the `-g` flag during compilation.
