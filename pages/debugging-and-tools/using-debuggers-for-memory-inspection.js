        Using Debuggers for Memory Inspection: Unmasking the Secrets of Memory 
      </h1>

      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Ever feel like your C++ program is speaking a secret language,
        especially when it comes to memory management?  It's like trying to
        understand what's going on behind the scenes of a magic trick.  Don't worry, 
        debuggers are here to be your trusty sidekick, giving you X-ray vision into 
        your program's memory!  In this chapter, we'll learn how to use debuggers to 
        inspect memory, track down elusive bugs, and become memory management masters! ü™Ñ
      </p>

      {/* Code Example (if applicable) */}

        {`#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int(10); // Allocate memory dynamically

    // ... some code ...

    delete ptr;  // Free the allocated memory
    
    return 0;
}`}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>

      {/* Explanation */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In this example, we use <code>new</code> to allocate memory dynamically
        for an integer and store the address in the pointer <code>ptr</code>. 
        Later, we use <code>delete</code> to free up that memory. Forgetting 
        to free memory can lead to memory leaks, while accessing freed memory can 
        cause crashes.  A debugger can help us monitor these memory allocations and 
        deallocations, ensuring everything is running smoothly!

        Imagine you're a detective investigating a case of missing memory.  Your 
        program is the crime scene, and a sneaky memory leak is the culprit!  Your

        to find the line of code responsible for this memory leak.

            **Solution 1:** Debuggers provide a more comprehensive and interactive 
            view of memory compared to console prints. They allow you to pause execution, 
            inspect the values of variables at different points in time, and even 
            visualize memory layouts.  
          </p>
          <p>
            **Solution 2:**  Two common memory-related errors are:
            <br />
            - **Memory Leaks:** Failing to deallocate dynamically allocated memory, leading to wasted resources. Debuggers can track allocations and deallocations, making it easier to spot leaks.
            <br />
            - **Dangling Pointers/Segmentation Faults:** Accessing memory that has already been freed or is out of scope.  Debuggers can help you identify the exact line of code where a segmentation fault occurs, often pinpointing the use of a dangling pointer.
