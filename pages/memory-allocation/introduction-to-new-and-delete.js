        Introduction to new and delete: Dynamic Memory Allocation Like a Pro

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Ever wished you could create objects in C++ on the fly, only when
        you need them? That's where the magic of <code>new</code> and
        <code>delete</code> comes in! These powerful keywords give you the
        ability to manage memory dynamically, making your programs more
        efficient and adaptable. ü™Ñ

        {`#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Using 'new' to allocate memory for an integer
    int *ptr = new int; 

    // Assigning a value
    *ptr = 42; 

    std::cout << "Value at ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl;

    // Don't forget to free the memory when you're done!
    delete ptr;

      {/* Explanation */}
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In this example, <code>new int</code> requests the operating system for
        a chunk of memory just big enough to hold an integer. The OS returns the
        memory address, which we store in the pointer <code>ptr</code>. Think
        of <code>ptr</code> as a label pointing to the newly allocated memory
        location.  We use <code>*ptr</code> to access and modify the value
        stored at that address. But remember, with great power comes great
        responsibility! Once we're done, <code>delete ptr</code> gives the
        memory back to the OS, preventing those nasty memory leaks! üóëÔ∏è

        Let's put your newfound knowledge to the test! Write a C++ program that
        uses <code>new</code> to dynamically allocate memory for two integers.
        Assign the values 10 and 20 to these integers. Then, print their sum.
        Finally, be a responsible coder and free the allocated memory using
        <code>delete</code>. üí™

            <strong>Answer 1:</strong> <code>new</code> and
            <code>delete</code> allow for dynamic memory allocation, meaning you
            can allocate memory during program execution instead of at compile
            time. This makes your programs more efficient and adaptable to
            varying data sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Answer 2:</strong> Using <code>delete</code> on a pointer
            that doesn't point to dynamically allocated memory leads to
            undefined behavior. This could crash your program or cause other
            unexpected issues. üíÄ
