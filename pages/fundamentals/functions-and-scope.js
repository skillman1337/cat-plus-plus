        Imagine having to repeat the same chunk of code over and over again like
        a broken record. It would be tedious, repetitive, and about as fun as
        watching paint dry. That's where functions come in. They're like
        reusable blocks of code that you can call upon whenever you need them,
        saving you time, effort, and sanity.

int calculateArea(int length, int width) { // Function definition
  int area = length * width;
  return area;
}

int main() {
  int result = calculateArea(5, 10); // Function call
  std::cout << "The area is: " << result << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
`}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In this example, the "calculateArea" function takes two arguments
        (length and width), calculates the area, and returns the result. It's
        like a mini-program within your program, doing your bidding without
        complaint.

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Scope is like your code's personal bodyguard, ensuring that variables
        stay within their designated areas and don't get into any trouble. Think
        of it like this: each function has its own private room, and variables
        declared inside that room are like top-secret documents that can't be
        accessed from the outside.
      </p>

        {`#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x = 10; // This variable has global scope.

  {
    int y = 20; // This variable has block scope.
  }

  std::cout << x << std::endl; // This will print 10.
  // std::cout << y << std::endl; // This will cause an error! 'y' is out of scope.

  return 0;
}
`}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In this example, the variable "x" has global scope, meaning it can be
        accessed from anywhere in the program. The variable "y," on the other
        hand, has block scope, meaning it can only be accessed within the curly
        braces where it's declared. Trying to access "y" outside of its scope
        will result in a compiler error faster than you can say "segmentation
        fault."

            promote code reusability, reduce redundancy, and make your code

            organization, swooping in to save the day from spaghetti code and

            <strong>2. Global vs. Local Scope:</strong> Global scope means a
            variable can be accessed from anywhere in the program, while local
            scope means a variable can only be accessed within the block of code
            where it's declared. Understanding the difference is crucial for
            preventing naming conflicts, improving code organization, and
            generally keeping your code from turning into a chaotic mess.
