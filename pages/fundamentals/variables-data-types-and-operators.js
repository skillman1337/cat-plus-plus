        Imagine trying to cook a gourmet meal without any containers. You'd have
        ingredients scattered everywhere, sauce dripping off the counter, and a
        one-way ticket to a kitchen nightmare. That's what programming is like
        without variables. They're the containers that hold your data, keeping
        your code organized and your sanity intact.
      </p>

        {`int age = 25; // This variable holds an integer (whole number).
double bankBalance = 1000000.50; // This variable holds a double (decimal number).  Hey, a programmer can dream, right?
std::string name = "Neo"; // This variable holds a string (text).
bool isAwesome = true; // This variable holds a boolean (true or false).  Spoiler alert: you're awesome.
`}

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        See those words like "int," "double," "string," and "bool"? Those are
        data types. They tell the compiler what kind of data a variable can
        hold. It's like labeling your Tupperware so you don't accidentally put
        your leftover pizza in with your ice cream. (Unless you're into that
        sort of thing. No judgment here.)

        Operators: The Mathematical Ninjas of Your Code ðŸ¥·
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Operators are the symbols that let you perform operations on your data.
        They're like the knives, forks, and spoons of the coding world, allowing
        you to slice, dice, and manipulate your data with surgical precision.
      </p>

        {`int a = 10 + 5; // Addition: a will be 15.
int b = 10 - 5; // Subtraction: b will be 5.
int c = 10 * 5; // Multiplication: c will be 50.
int d = 10 / 5; // Division: d will be 2.
int e = 10 % 3; // Modulo (remainder): e will be 1.
`}
      </SyntaxHighlighter>

      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        But wait, there's more! Operators aren't just for math. You can use them
        to compare values, combine strings, and even manipulate bits like a
        digital wizard.

            <strong>1. Variables vs. Data Types:</strong> A variable is like a
            container that holds data, while a data type is like a label that
            tells the compiler what kind of data the container can hold. Using
            the right data type ensures that your data is stored and manipulated
            correctly. It's like putting the right lid on your Tupperware â€“ you
            don't want your spaghetti sauce spilling all over your fridge.

          <p>
            <strong>2. Operators: The Swiss Army Knives of Code:</strong>
            Operators are symbols that let you perform operations on your data.
            There are arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), comparison operators
            (==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=), logical operators (&&, ||, !),
            bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;), and more.
            They're the tools that let you manipulate your data and make your
            code do interesting things.
